This font collection is an amalgamation of fonts licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 
and fonts with comparable open licenses, i.e. suitable for use in both personal, business and other websites.

The SASS / CSS (@fontface defining) source codes provided in this repository itself 
have been produced by me to facilitate this usage and are placed in the public domain
under the MIT license.

NOTE:

Any support files provided with the fonts in the referenced git submodules in this repository
are copyright their respective creators and reside under their specific licenses.

As the purpose and use of this collection is to only use the "final" font files (OTF, TTF, EOT, WOFF, WOFF2 formats) 
together with my own provided SASS (SCSS) / CSS @fontface definitions, do only *their* licenses apply.

If you re-use any toolchain files that came with any of the fonts, then their licenses may apply to you too,
but that is NOT the purpose of this collection, where you are expected to only use the font and SASS/CSS files 
described in the previous paragraph.


(The above is clarification for those that get their knickers in a twist over robot-generated license reports, 
which cry havoc because the simple machine cannot parse the license structure.)
